  executors: `
        An Executor also known as trustee is a person responsible for executing and administering your wishes, and distributing your estate in accordance with your Will/Wassiyah after you deceased.
        Here are some important points:\n
        1. Executor has to be older than 18, honest, capable, who fully understands the importance of everything to go according to the Islamic law and is able and willing to accept the responsibility.\n
        2. It is highly recommended to have more than one executor as a backup.\n
        3. It is highly recommended that the executor is a practising Muslim or with knowledge of who to ask and where to go in regards to funeral and barriers etc..\n
        4. Death is a difficult time, choose an executor who will be able to act in the time of your death and don't burden your loved ones as it can be overwhelming.\n
        5. It is highly recommended that the executor is in the city you live in, otherwise it might not be practical.\n
        6. It is recommended to inform the executor(s) that you put their name(s) in your Will/Wassiyah.\n
        7. If the executor moves or you move, you can change the executors for free with us.
        `,
  guardians: `
          1. In Canada, if one parent dies, minors (below 18) and their estate will go to the other parent.\n
          2. Guardian is when both parents die.\n
          3. Guardian has to be someone trustworthy and who will take care of the kids deen.\n
          4. If you want your kids to be raised by your family overseas, put the guardian as someone local until your family can come to take the kids through court. If you did not do that, kids might be in foster homes until the court decides.\n
          5. It is recommended to inform the executor(s) that you put their name(s) in your Will/Wassiyah.

  charities: `
        Charitable Contributions And Testamentary Transfer
            1. You can not write the name of someone who is an inheritor according to Islamic law.
            2. You total charitable contributions can not exceed the third of your estate.
            3. You can enter the name of a person or an organization.
        `,
  witnesses: `
        1. The two witnesses cannot be a beneficiary or a parent or a spouse of a beneficiary of your estate. This means the witnesses cannot be people who will receive something (i.e. a benefit) from your estate when you die.\n
        2. It is enough to have 2 witnesses. a 3rd is optional. \n
        3. We highly recommend doing an affidavit as it will save you a lot of headache in case the will needs to go to court or in case something happens to the witnesses before you. (We will walk you through how to do it after finishing)\n
        4. The two witnesses must also sign the Will. All three (you and your two witnesses) must be together when signing.\n
        5. The executor named in the Will can be a witness as long as he or she is not also a beneficiary.
      `,
  backup: `This is just in case there is some remaining money for any reason. Some of those reasons could be an individual rejecting their inheritance. You can put it as a charity organization.`,
